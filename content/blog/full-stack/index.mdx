# Full Stack Development

## What is a Full Stack developer?

A full-stack web developer is a technology expert who can work on both in the front end as well the back-end of any application. The person should be familiar with each layer of a 3-tier model. The 3-tier consists of

- The presentation layer ( Main front end portion which deals with the user interface),
- Business Logic Layer (back-end portion of any application which deals with data validation)
- Database Layer

A Full-Stack Developer doesn't necessarily master of all technologies. However, the professional is expected to work on the client as well as server sides and understand what is going on when developing an application. He or she should have a genuine interest in all software technologies.
